        <p>I wanted a chat bot and an assistant for coding. I imagined a bot that could remind me of code snippets or links. Could tell others about me and what I can do or services I can provide.</p>
        <p>I do not want a bot that can think on it's own or learn on the fly. I want a utility bot that I can play with. Feed it the information I want to remember and see how close I can get to making it feel like a real AI.</p>
        <p>As of now, Ruby is not connected to a database, so any conversation is not recorded. It is not using local storage, so any information acquired by Ruby will be gone once you leave.</p>
        <p>I invite you to ask Ruby anything. I welcome any advice, questions, or concerns. Ask Ruby the best way to contact me.</p>
