- It is a horrible thing. A corona virus found in 2019. Two things made it so bad. 1, It is easily transmitted through people's cough or sneeze. 2, You can have it, be contagious, and never have a symptom. Some people never know they have it. Other's it kill's quickly.

- It is trully surprising how many people in the US can be so opinionated about being so ignorate. To educate one's self is to respect one's self. I suggest they are ignorant because if they were stupid, far more people would be burned by hot stoves on a daily basis.
