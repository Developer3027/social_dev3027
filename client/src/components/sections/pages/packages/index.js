        Getting started with a website can seem complicated. Let’s see if we can
        simplify it a bit. The first thing you need is a domain name and
        hosting.
      </LightText>
      <LightText>
        The domain name is the registered name the world can find you at. Nearly
        any hosting service is going to have a way for you to register a domain
        name. A domain name is going to have an extension like .com or .org. You
        should do some research in this regard. There are some 280 different
        domain extensions delegated globally. You may wish to incorporate the
        extension into your name by using .ly or .me like bit.ly did. There are
        extensions with restrictions you may want to take advantage of like .us
        which is only for us citizens, organizations or foreign entities with a
        us presence. There are extensions that are common to television, radio,
        organizations, and networks that help both sell your brand and organize
        the web.
      </LightText>
      <LightText>
        Now that you have the name, it is time to find a home. Your hosting
        provider will give you a place to set up your site and point the domain
        name to it. A good hosting provider will give you a ton of options you
        may not be familiar with. They also explain themselves well and have a
        customer service department.
      </LightText>
      <LightText>
        Some things to consider when looking for hosting. Is there customer
        support? Are subdomains an option? Is there a uptime guarantee? Are
        there options for shared and dedicated server space? Do they use ssd
        drives? In many cases, a “yes” depends on the package you get, and that
        is ok. You want to ensure you can get the service or performance you
        need as you expand and grow.

        There are several different ways that web site / app developers choose
        to handle dealing with domain registration and hosting. I prefer to
        assist my clients in getting the domain and hosting locked down, then
        receive access from the client. When you get the hosting you will
        receive a email and password. Simply hand that information over to me
        and I will take it from there.
      </LightText>
      <LightText>
        In my opinion the name and hosting should be owned by the client from
        start to finish. This gives the client the control from the start. As a
        designer and a developer, I am not constrained to the name or the host
        and can start work before this process is complete. Whether you want a
        app or site, I have tools that allow me to collaborate with clients
        during design and tech that allows clients to preview the site or app in
        progress.

        I can offer a simple site of just a few pages. I bake SEO meta data into
        every site. All sites today require either social platforms to be set up
        or links to be integrated. You may need to work with a copywriter or
        need design work, both of which I can assist with.

      <LightText>
        No matter the project, big or small, my goal is to provide you with an
        excellence of service. From our first meeting I will help guide you
        through this process. From acquiring the domain and hosting to every
        other step along the way. There is no reason for us to split ways once
        the project is complete. In many cases, projects are completed in
        phases, whether they are designed that way or not. That is why I have
        this maintenance package. I am here to help you exceed your goals, guide
        you and teach you. My job is not done once you have your product. You
        will need little tweaks, minor fixes, plugins or tech updated and bugs
        fixed due to those updates or ensure your SSL certificates don’t run
        out. With this package I stay on top of your project and ensure it stays
        fresh, clean and working for you.

      <LightTitleThree>WordPress with Elementor</LightTitleThree>
      <LightText>
        WordPress is the most common way sites are built today. Elementor is the
        number one plugin for wordpress that easily allows wordpress developers
        to create professional looking and functional sites quickly. Clients
        really like this arrangement for several reasons. Top on that list is
        the easy of switching developers. Having a site built with the most used
        platform and the most common plugin ensures that the client site can be
        worked on by the widest range of developers, now or in the future. It
        allows clients the freedom to organize and build sites in stages as well
        as shop around developers for the best price.
      </LightText>
      <LightText>
        I use Elementor Pro to build my WordPress sites. The pro version of
        Elementor requires a yearly subscription of $49. I break this into a
        monthly payment of $4.50 that is included in the maintenance and upkeep
        of the site.

      <LightTitleThree>SEO – Search Engine Optimisation</LightTitleThree>
      <LightText>
        SEO is important for every site. I am not a SEO professional but I do
        include SEO meta data tags in every site. This meta data performs two
        important tasks. It provides sites and apps the information they need to
        format that nice card preview when linking the site, as well as giving
        search engine bots the information they need to find and list your site.
